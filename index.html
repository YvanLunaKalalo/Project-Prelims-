                <h3>School Opened</h3>
                <P>The school opened in June 2000 with 19 selected students out of the 72 students who took the examination and with the founders as the first teachers together with Mrs. Miriam Simera-Ramos.</P>

                <h3>Logo</h3>
                
                <P>Mount Maculot, which faces it to the west, served as inspiration for the school's logo. The mountain stands for a difficulty that the school and its pupils must overcome. Getting to the top, succeeding, and enjoying the victory are the challenges. Another way that the  challenge is described is to "climb the mountain to kiss the clouds." On the other hand, "climbing the mountain" refers to the school's efforts to give its students the finest learning environment possible. For the students, it entails pushing themselves to the absolute limit to attain academic achievement.</p>
